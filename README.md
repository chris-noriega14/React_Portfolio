Description:

This webpage is a brief overview of who I am, my current experience as a web developer, completed projects, and methods of contact.

The NavBar displays four separate links for Home, About, Projects, and Contact that lead to those sections in the webpage.

The Home section displays a photo of me. The header is listed as "Full-Stack Web Developer".

The About section describes my current experience as a web developer.

The Projects section has three assignments that we have worked on so far: The first two projects and the work day scheduler homework. The project name, description, GitHub URL, and live link are listed below each project.

The Contact section has four methods of contact: Phone Number, Email Address, LinkedIn, and GitHub. The LinkedIn and GitHub sections are linked to my personal pages at each of those websites.
